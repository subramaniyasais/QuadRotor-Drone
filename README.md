# QuadRotor-Drone
# Academic Project 2013
An automated quad copter based on the Arduino platform with the Atmel ATmega328 Microcontroller as its core, designed to avoid collisions and stabilize automatically.

The quad-copter can be controlled via a computer/smartphone and is primarily based on the Arduino open source, prototyping platform, with the Atmel ATmega328 micro-controller serving as the core. The microcontroller is programmed in its native Arduino C language. The Arduino can read data from a variety of sensors and can also send outputs to control them. The data are read using applications written in Processing. The DC motors are driven by the ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers) based on the Arduino signals. The Arduino reads data from the gyroscope and ultrasonic sensors and generates correction data to keep the quad-copter stable during level flight and to avoid collisions. The total lifting thrust is the sum of the individual thrusts generated by the propellers and as a result, the total thrust is quite high for a device of its size. The motion of the quad-copter is achieved by controlling the rotational speeds of the propellers individually.
